Introduction

What is Proxmox Offline Mirror?
-------------------------------

This tool consists of two binaries, ``proxmox-offline-mirror`` (mirror tool to create
and manage mirrors and media containing repositories) and ``proxmox-apt-repo``
(helper to use media on offline systems).

There are three basic entity types available for configuration:

- keys, either for the mirroring system itself, or for the offline systems

  - configured with ``proxmox-offline-mirror key ...``

- mirrors, consisting of upstream repository metadata and a local path where snapshots are stored

  - configured with ``proxmox-offline-mirror config mirror ...``

  - used with ``proxmox-offline-mirror mirror ...``

- media, consisting of local mirrors and a path where mirrors are synced to

  - configured with ``proxmox-offline-mirror config medium ...``

  - used with ``proxmox-offline-mirror medium ...``

Behind the scenes, one or more `pools` consisting of

- a pool directory containing checksum files (e.g., `sha256/3dc7bc5f82cdcc4ea0f69dd30d5f6bb19e0ccc36f4a79c865eed0e7a370cd5e4`)
- a base directory containing directories and hardlinks to checksum files inside the pool directory

are used for space-efficient storing of repository contents ("snapshots").

Adding a file consists of first adding the checksum file(s), then linking them
under one or more paths. a garbage collect operation will iterate over all
files in the base directory and remove those which are not (or no longer) a
hardlink to any checksum files, and remove any checksum files which have no
hardlinks outside of the pool checksum file directories.

A default config path of ``/etc/proxmox-offline-mirror.cfg`` is used, but is
overridable on a per command basis (for example, to allow operation as non-root
user).

Offline subscription keys
=========================

When using ``proxmox-offline-mirror`` with a corresponding Proxmox Offline Mirror subscription key,
it is possible to update subscription information for air-gapped systems or those without access
to the public internet.
 
First, add the mirror key using ``proxmox-offline-mirror key add-mirror-key``. This command will
activate the subscription of the mirroring system.
 
Next, gather the server IDs of the systems that shall be set up for offline keys, and add them
together with the system's subscription key using ``proxmox-offline-mirror key add``. By default,
this command will fetch updated subscription information from Proxmox licensing servers.

You can refresh the subscription information for a single (``--key XX``) or all configured keys
using ``proxmox-offline-mirror key refresh``. The subscription information is transferred to a
medium (see below) and can then be activated on the offline system with either
``proxmox-apt-repo offline-key`` or ``proxmox-apt-repo setup``. This process must be repeated at least
once a year or before the nextduedate of the subscription key is reached, whichever comes first.

.. note:: Configuring an active product subscription key (*as well as* a Proxmox Offline Mirror
   subscription) is required for ``proxmox-offline-mirror`` to be able to access and mirror a
   product's enterprise repository.

Offline repository mirrors
==========================

Setting up a mirror
-------------------

First either run the ``setup`` wizard (``proxmox-offline-mirror setup``), or the
``config mirror add`` command. For example, to add a mirror entry for the Debian
Bullseye security repository, the following command can be used:

.. code-block:: console
  
  proxmox-offline-mirror config mirror add \
   --id debian-bullseye-security \
   --architectures amd64 \
   --architectures all \
   --repository 'deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main contrib non-free' \
   --key-path /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/debian-archive-bullseye-security-automatic.gpg \
   --sync true \
   --verify true \
   --base-dir /path/to/mirror/dir/debian-bullseye-security \
   --pool-dir /path/to/mirror/dir/debian-bullseye-security/.pool

Syncing a mirror
----------------

To create the first (and subsequent) snapshots, the following command can be used:

.. code-block:: console
  
  proxmox-offline-mirror mirror snapshot create --id debian-bullseye-security

.. note:: Depending on the parameters used and the size of the original repository, creating a
  snapshot can take both time and require significant disk space. This is especially true for the
  initial snapshot, as subsequent ones will re-use unchanged package files and indices.

Space management
----------------

After removing a snapshot with ``proxmox-offline-mirror mirror snapshot remove``, a
``proxmox-offline-mirror mirror gc`` invocation is needed to actually remove any no longer needed
contents from the underlying hard link pool.

Offline media
=============

Setting up a medium
-------------------

Either run the ``setup`` wizard again, or use the ``config medium add`` command.
For example, to define a new medium containing the
`proxmox-ve-bullseye-no-subscription` and `debian-bullseye` mirrors, run the
following command:

.. code-block:: console

  proxmox-offline-mirror config medium add \
   --id pve-bullseye \
   --mirrors proxmox-ve-bullseye-no-subscription \
   --mirrors debian-bullseye \
   --sync true \
   --verify true \
   --mountpoint /path/where/medium/is/mounted

Syncing a medium
----------------

To sync the local mirrors to a medium, the following command can be used:

.. code-block:: console
  
  proxmox-offline-mirror medium sync --id pve-bullseye

This command will sync all mirrors linked with this medium to the medium's mountpoint, as well as
sync all offline keys for further processing by ``proxmox-apt-repo`` on the target system.

Using a medium
--------------

After syncing a medium, unmount it and make it accessible on the (offline)
target system. You can now either manually point apt at the synced snapshots,
or run ``proxmox-apt-repo setup`` to generate a sources.list.d snippet referecing
selected mirrors and snapshots. Don't forget to remove the snippet again after
the upgrade is done.

To activate or update an offline subscription key, either use ``proxmox-apt-repo offline-key`` or
``proxmox-apt-repo setup``.
