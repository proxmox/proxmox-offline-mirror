What is Proxmox Offline Mirror?
-------------------------------

With the Proxmox Offline Mirror tool, you can manage a local apt mirror for all package updates for
Proxmox and Debian projects. From this local apt mirror you can create an external medium, for
example a USB flash drive or a local network share, to update systems which cannot access the
package repositories directly via the internet.  Such systems might be restricted by policies to
access the public internet or are completely air-gapped.  Finally, you can also manage subscriptions
for such restricted hosts.

This tool consists of two binaries:

``proxmox-offline-mirror``
  The mirror tool to create and manage mirrors and media containing repositories

``proxmox-apt-repo``
  The helper to use the external medium on offline Proxmox VE, Proxmox Mail Gateway or Proxmox
  Backup Server systems as well as managing subscriptions on these systems.

Terminology
-----------

There are three basic entity types available for configuration:

*keys*
  Subscription keys are either for the mirroring system itself, or for the offline systems.

  They are configured with ``proxmox-offline-mirror key ...``

*mirrors*
  A mirror consists of the metadata of an upstream repository and a local path where **snapshots**
  of the upstream repository are stored.

  - configured with ``proxmox-offline-mirror config mirror ...``

  - used with ``proxmox-offline-mirror mirror ...``

*media*
  A medium consisting of local mirrors and a path where the mirrors are synced to

  - configured with ``proxmox-offline-mirror config medium ...``

  - used with ``proxmox-offline-mirror medium ...``


Technical Overview
------------------

Behind the scenes, one or more `pools` consisting of

- a pool directory containing checksum files (e.g., `sha256/3dc7bc5f82cdcc4ea0f69dd30d5f6bb19e0ccc36f4a79c865eed0e7a370cd5e4`)
- a base directory containing directories and hardlinks to the checksum files inside the pool
  directory

are used to store the repository contents ("snapshots") in a space-efficient way.

When adding a file, the following steps are done: first the ckecksum file(s) are added, then they
are linked under one or more paths.  A garbage collect operation will iterate over all files in the
base directory and remove those, which are not (or no longer) a hardlink to any checksum files. It
will also remove any checksum files which have no hardlinks outside of the pool's checksum file
directories.

The default config path is ``/etc/proxmox-offline-mirror.cfg``, but it can be overriden on a per
command basis (for example, to allow operation as a non-root user). Use the ``--config`` CLI option or
the ``PROXMOX_OFFLINE_MIRROR_CONFIG`` environment variable.
