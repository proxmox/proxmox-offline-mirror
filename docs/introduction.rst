Introduction

What is Proxmox Offline Mirror?
-------------------------------

With Proxmox Offline Mirror (POM) you can manage a local apt mirror for all Proxmox and Debian
projects package updates. You can also export this mirror to a external medium to update systems
that cannot connect to the repositories via HTTP, for example due to being completely air-gapped.
Finally you can also manage subscription for such restricted hosts.

This tool consists of two binaries:

``proxmox-offline-mirror``
  The mirror tool to create and manage mirrors and media containing repositories

``proxmox-apt-repo``
  The helper to use media and setup subscription key on offline Proxmox VE,
  Proxmox Mail Gateway or Proxmox Backup Server systems

Terminology
-----------

There are three basic entity types available for configuration:

*keys*
  Subscription keys are either for the mirroring system itself, or for the offline systems.

  They are configured with ``proxmox-offline-mirror key ...``

*mirrors*
  A mirror consists of an upstream repository metadata and a local path where **snapshots** of the
  upstream repository are stored.

  - configured with ``proxmox-offline-mirror config mirror ...``

  - used with ``proxmox-offline-mirror mirror ...``

*media*
  A medium consisting of local mirrors and a path where mirrors are synced to

  - configured with ``proxmox-offline-mirror config medium ...``

  - used with ``proxmox-offline-mirror medium ...``


Technical Overview
------------------

Behind the scenes, one or more `pools` consisting of

- a pool directory containing checksum files (e.g., `sha256/3dc7bc5f82cdcc4ea0f69dd30d5f6bb19e0ccc36f4a79c865eed0e7a370cd5e4`)
- a base directory containing directories and hardlinks to checksum files inside the pool directory

are used for space-efficient storing of repository contents ("snapshots").

Adding a file consists of first adding the checksum file(s), then linking them under one or more
paths. a garbage collect operation will iterate over all files in the base directory and remove
those which are not (or no longer) a hardlink to any checksum files, and remove any checksum files
which have no hardlinks outside of the pool checksum file directories.

A default config path of ``/etc/proxmox-offline-mirror.cfg`` is used, but is overridable on a per
command basis (for example, to allow operation as non-root user).
